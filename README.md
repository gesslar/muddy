HEY!

Do you love [muddler](https://github.com/demonnic/muddler)?? ME TOO!!! If you
_don't_, then you it only stands to reason that you are entirely ignorant of
the amazing work of [@demonnic](https://github.com/demonnic). And that is
inexcusable. Because _he is a god_ and you need to worship at the altar that is
his amazing work.

That said, I wish it weren't written in Java, cos I can't help. `:'(`

But I know a few bars of [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).

I have tried to make this **muddy** work as closely to **muddler** as I could.
Maybe it worked, maybe I failed miserably. idfk, it 'Works on My Computer™'.

My version is a clean-room implementation and I haven't even peeked at
demonnic's, because, frankly, as implicated above, I am woefully inadequate
for the Java. Which, honestly? I'm fine with.

So, if you want to use **muddy**, the syntax is the same. The structure it
expects is the same. The output is... errr, probably... the same... ish?

I'm not gonna re-teach you how to use an identical cli-based thing, when,
to repeat, the amazing god that is demonnic has already strived... strove...
striven? to do it already and it's great.

The only difference between invoking **muddy** over **muddler** is the cli.

## Immediate Invocation

```shell
# pnpm
pnpx @gesslar/muddy --help

# npm
npx @gesslar/muddy --help
```

## Install as a dependency, if you want, you don't have to

```shell
# pnpm
pnpm add -d @gesslar/muddy

#npm
npm i -d @gesslar/muddy
```

## Post Hocktuah

I just realised that I didn't implement creating or scaffolding a new project
like **muddler** does. Maybe in the next version.

Also, shout out to [@Edru2](https://github.com/Edru2) for
[DeMuddler](https://github.com/Edru2/DeMuddler) which is just sex on a stick.

Which is exactly how everybody likes their sex, yes? Yes. Okay.

_did you know there's a javascript.com?? I just found that out. holy shit._
